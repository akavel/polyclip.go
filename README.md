As of Go version "Go 1 RC1" (March 2012), projects are not allowed to have names ending ".go", so this project was moved to: http://github.com/akavel/polyclip-go - please update your bookmarks.

Your imports shall need only small change - from:

    "github.com/akavel/polyclip.go" // wrong now

to:

    "github.com/akavel/polyclip-go" // OK!

About
-----

Library polyclip.go is a pure Go, MIT-licensed implementation of an [algorithm for Boolean operations on 2D polygons] [fmartin] (invented by F. Mart√≠nez, A.J. Rueda, F.R. Feito) -- that is, for calculation of polygon intersection, union, difference and xor.

The original paper describes the algorithm as performing in time _O((n+k) log n)_, where _n_ is number of all edges of all polygons in operation, and _k_ is number of intersections of all polygon edges.
